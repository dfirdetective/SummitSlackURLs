# SummitSlackURLs

While practicing Python, I thought I could automate my normal link collection from the SANS Summits. This script currently works. If the the python script is run in the unzipped "Slack export" folder and it will create a text file in the same folder called "SlackOutput.txt" with the URL output and URLs held for review (mostly socials). I will be working on additional functionality as time allows.

This has been tested against a very small dataset with some anomalous data and appears to work as expected.
