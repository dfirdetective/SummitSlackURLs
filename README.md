# SummitSlackURLs

This script currently works. If the the python script is run in the unzipped "Slack export" folder and it will create a text file in the same folder called "SlackOutput.txt" with the URL output and URLs held for review. 

This has been tested against a very small dataset with some anomalous data and appears to work as expected.
